The goal of the project is to learn slam / reimplement it on my own in go.

I got data from Nikolai!

I analyzed the code.



Sunday, 17th of May
-------------------
Yesterday completed the bresenham debugging.
Today working on correlation 2d.

There is a little problem that gonum matrices only support float64 numbers.
This means for processing img data we can:
- treat uint8 arrays as normal slices / arrays.
- use image library

For now I think I will leave the correlation alone, because it is unclear
yet how the correlation function will be used.

So now I will focus on transferring the data from python to go.

We will need some protobuf messages. We will serialize to these on python side
and read them again in go.

Done serializing messages on python side!
Now will read them and show them in go!
